# LibertyAI: A Libertarian ChatGPT

This project is called LibertyAI.
Its goal is to use FaceBook LLaMA for recreating ChatGPT only without all the nasty woke
censorship going on.

For the back end LangChain is being used.

In order to avoid the annoying loading time when restarting the application, the model
is loaded separately and exposed to other applications through an API interface.

In order to avoid someone taxing your GPU power, by using your API, when you expose
the interface to the interwebs, I've introduced an API key feature.

You can go checkout the configuration file ~/.config/LibertyAI/config.ini for editing
the autogenerated API key as well as the database configuration.

You can use any API key for protecting your private computing resources you want,
you're free to do whatever you want, it's your GPUs.

Until the huggingface support for LLaMA is in the official transformers repository
I suggest you install my merge of the tracked HF repo with the incorporated changes
from https://github.com/zphang/transformers/tree/llama_push, by running

    pip3 install https://github.com/leviathanch/transformers/archive/refs/heads/main.tar.gz

after that you can install LibertyAI with

    pip3 install -e .

## Web interface

You can go into the folder web and execute:

    npm ci
    npm run dev # or: npm run build

## Vector DB support

It's ABSOLUTELY important that you install the vector DB support for Postgres
in order to store your embeddings in the database.
That's how our Libertarian hopefully soon to be AGI can have a long term memory,
learn on the fly, and hopefully figure out soon, how to end government and taxes,
and enforece the NAP on a global scale.

Go to https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector, clone the repo and follow the instructions.

## Create Postgres DB

You can create a password using pwgen or whatever generator you like

    sudo su postgres
    psql
    postgres=# create database libertyai;
    postgres=# create user libertyai with encrypted password 'p4ssw0rd';
    postgres=# grant all privileges on database libertyai to libertyai;
    postgres=# grant all privileges on schema public to libertyai;
    postgres=# grant postgres to libertyai;
    postgres=# exit
    psql libertyai
    libertyai# create extension vector;
    libertyai# exit

You can set the credentials and name of the database in the configuration file
~/.config/LibertyAI/config.ini as well.
