# LibertyAI: A Libertarian ChatGPT

This project is called LibertyAI, it's goal is to use FaceBook LLaMA for recreating
ChatGPT only without all the nasty woke censorship going on.

For the back end LangChain is being used.

In order to avoid the annoying loading time when restart the application, the model
is loaded separately and exposed to other applications through an API interface.
